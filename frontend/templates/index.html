                    <p>As well as casual weekend sailing, why not try your hand at University Team Racing?<p>

                    <p>The University of Kent has competed nationally for several years, and is growing rapidly. If you're an experienced
                racer, or would just like to try out something new, please watch our Facebook and Twitter for announcements of the team
                tryouts. Typically we train every Wednesday afternoon and hold a short theory session over drinks on Friday afternoons.
                It's a great chance to try out a new style of racing, or hone your skills against other universities.</p>

                    <p>If you have any questions, or want to know more please get in touch with our Race Captain!</p>
